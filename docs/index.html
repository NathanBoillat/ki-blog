      <h2>Künstliche Intelligenz</h2>
      <p>
Our game is a rpg game based on the 
pokemon game series and the associated
game princips. Overall our rpg game is devided
into three different parts which
are all presented by a specific 
island and asscociated fights. The youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP5DKzriqXA">Chris Courses</a> was thereby our inspiration and he provided us with some usable sprites and ideas. 
      </p>
      <h4>Funktionsweise</h4>
      <p>
All of the three islands, which represent the whole game world, 
are suffering from a dangerous 
slime invasion. Save and rescue the citiziens from the slimes by
fighting against them whith your own white pet slime, Alex!
You begin the game in your own villige and move on to
the other islands by boat. You are going to have to interact
with different citiziens who provide you with helpful commentaries and hints.
Every time you beat slimes, you gain experience and 
rise in level what influences the battle strength of your slime, Alex. 
The enemy slimes get stronger from island to island, which are reachable by boat, so first 
you have to beat the slimes of the first island and rise in experience 
and level up to be able to move on and fight the enemy slimes of the next islands.
The whole population of The Three Islands are counting on you, so hurry up and good Luck!

First, good sprites and sources for the map and the player had to be found. 
These sprites were then imported to the map editor named <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org">Tiled</a>. With this tool
our map could be created by layering our sprites up to a specific layer, which all togeter 
form a map. Step by step the map was enlarged and details were added to it. Very important were 
also the collisions and the map boundaries, which already had to be placed in the map editor. 
Furthermore the foreground layers had to be fixed, so that the player could walk behind trees ect. 
what made the game more realistic.

The game "Slime Invasion" was developed by Lionel Frey and Nathan Boillat. The project was distributed according to strength and skill, while Nathan Boillat would be more focused on the different aspects of the grafics of the different maps and sprites, as well as on the creation of the Website of the game.
Lionel Frey used his good programming skills to mainly programme the movement of the char, the addaptation of the map into the game, the battle sequences and everything, what comes around it. Our only and main issue was only the time constraints. </p>

    <h2>Der Einfluss von Daten auf eine KI</h2>
    <p>
Our game is an rpg game map. To move on the map and win, use the  keys; W to move upwards, S to move downwards, A to move left, and D to move right.
Within the fight scene, everything is automatic and strictly regulated. By pressing an attack button, Alex executes one of his currently learned attacks and damages the opponent. The opponent then attacks with a variable attack of his choice. This game principle is repeated until one of the two fighting Slimes has no more life points and the fight is over.
